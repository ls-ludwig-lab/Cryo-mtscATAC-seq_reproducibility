# Cryo-mtscATAC-seq_reproducibility
Cryo-mtscATAC_seq_reproducibility repository

This repository contains all code needed to reproduce all analyses from:

# Data availabilty:
Files containing human genotyping information, such as mgatk outputs, are not hosted in this GitHub repository. 
Raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) will be deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and will be available under controlled access upon request.

# Setup
This github is structured based on manuscript chapters/ figures:

- Benchmarking of fresh cryopreserved vs. ’Cryo’ mtDNA sequencing in murine spleen
- mitoBender removes highly prevalent ambient mtDNA variants
- mtDNA genotyping reveals gliogenesis and clonal microglia dynamics in human nervous system pathologies
- Clonal dynamics in human glioblastoma evolution
- mtDNA copy number heterogeneity in pediatric tumors (please contant Marie.Cotta@charite.de)
- Clonal tracing of smooth muscle cells in human aorta 

MitoBender is available here: github.com/bihealth/mitobender
(please contact Benedikt.Obermayer@bih-charite.de
